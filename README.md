# housingPrices_Bogota
The objective of this project is to generate a predictive model of the price of a house located in the city of Bogota, Colombia, based on known characteristics of the property to be sold. The premise is that the potential user is not an expert in real estate or in cadastral appraisals, therefore, does not have technical tools in the field to make a judgment on the estimated selling price of their home. Therefore, a machine learning algorithm can be used to recommend the selling price of the property. The data to train the model were obtained by web scraping, using Selenium and Beautiful Soap, during the first week of April 2023 from the fincaraiz.com.co portal. It is clarified that the project has no commercial purposes but eminently academic. 

A new major upgrade was included in order to ensure full compatibility with Google Colaboratory. So, please refer to the webScraping_housing_fromColab notebook.
